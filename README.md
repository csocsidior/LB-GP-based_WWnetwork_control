## General info
This repository is a how-to documentation for the control toolchain designed in the work: "A Learning-based Approach Towards the Data-driven Predictive Control of Wastewater Networks – An Experimental Study". The project description is the following: 

(The abstract goes here.)
	
## Tools
Tools designed specifically for the Smart Water Laboratory experiments carried out in the project
* Manual control
* Lab setup initialization

## Documentation
Detailed documentation with illustrations for the topological layout and the physical description of the expereimental setup. 
* WW Lab setup (pdf)
	
## Simulator
An exact simulator designed specifically for the experimental setup. The simulator represents the equivalent of the Smart Water Lab. The purpose of this simulator is the reproducability of the tests in simulation in case the laboratory access is out of scope. The modelling used in the simulator setup is from the following article: 

*Balla, KM, Schou, C, Bendtsen, JD, Ocampo-Martinez, C & Kallesøe, C 2021, 'A Nonlinear Predictive Control Approach for Urban Drainage Networks Using Data-Driven Models and Moving Horizon Estimation', IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology.*

* simulator PDE based
* simulator GP

## Data collection
Randomized Onoff, rule-based Onoff and closed loop deterministic MPC data collection scripts for the experimental setup. 
* Onoff randomized data collection
* Rule-based Onoff data collection
